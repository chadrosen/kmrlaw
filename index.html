    <h3>Practical legal support for education and edtech organizations</h3>
    <div>      
      At KMR Law, I can provide counsel on discrete matters or act as a longer term advisor akin to a fractional general counsel. Think of me as your part-time legal partner, 
      on call for questions, guidance, or ongoing support. Or, reach out when you need help with a specific legal need. 
      My experience includes work with philanthropic organizations, ed tech companies, and schools. 
      With deep experience at the intersection of law and learning, I help organizations navigate complex issues with clarity and confidence.
